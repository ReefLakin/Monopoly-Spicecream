# The Monopoly House Rules Generator

## Background

During my time at university, I played a lot of Monopoly - the Hasbro family classic in which players live out their capitalist dreams over the course of 1 to 6000 hours, face the hardships of climbing the property ladder, and eventually end up hating everyone they once called a friend. I played this one <b>a lot</b>, mostly because it was one of the few games we actually had access to. It also helps that almost everyone knows the general rules and can get some enjoyment out of it, even if it means leaving "early" four hours in because you're out of beer, have a lecture in the morning, and it also went midnight quite some time ago.

You learn many things at university, one of which being: <b>you can indeed have too much of a good thing</b>. And by "good thing", I am, of course, talking about Monopoly. You may be in the large group of people who already know Monopoly can get boring, or maybe just the thought is enough to make you groan. Either way, we can all agree Monopoly would benefit from a little bit of spice.
